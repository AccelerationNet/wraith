We're always happy to receive Pull Requests from the Wraith community.

Guidelines:

* Make sure your PR is documented (What does it do? Why is it needed?)
* New features and bug fixes should have tests written alongside them
* Appreciate that contributors maintain Wraith in their spare time, so a response may take several weeks

A PR is more likely to be merged if it fixes one of [Wraith's open issues](https://github.com/BBC-News/wraith/issues).
