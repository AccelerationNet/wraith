These JavaScript files have been provided by Wraith for your benefit, but you are free to edit these or add new JavaScript files if you wish.

Files beginning with an underscore should not be referenced directly in your YAML files. They are 'private' modules required by some of the other modules in this directory.

The two most important files to be aware of are `casper.js` and `_phantom__common.js`, as these files map Wraith's command line arguments to each respective browser engine.
